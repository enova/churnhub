ChurnHub
========

A rails app for viewing codbase churn statistics. If you want to churn a
github.com-hosted repository, try the [demo site](http://churnhub.io).

The demo site should also work for any public facing enterprise installations.

## Installation

If you want stats for a repo hosted on a private github enterprise server,
you can install ChurnHub on a local machine and churn in the privacy of your
own home.

    $ git clone https://github.com/enova/churnhub.git
    $ cd churnhub
    $ bundle
    $ rails s

Now point your browser at `localhost:3000` and churn away!
